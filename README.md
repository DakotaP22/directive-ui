# Directive UI
Directive UI is a toy project with a few goals in mind to push my angular knowledge:
1. Create a functional UI library that is easy to use.
2. Do my best to stick to using directives and native HTML elements to create the UI "blocks"
3. Implement a themeing system that is dead simple to customize.
4. Make everything fully custimizable through css variables.
